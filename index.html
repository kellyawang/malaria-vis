                    <p>Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite and is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes which bite
                        between dusk and dawn. People infected with malaria often experience fever, chills and flu-like illness at first.
                        Left untreated, the disease can lead to severe complications and, in some cases, death.</p>

                <h2>Malaria Parasites</h2>
                <h4>Malaria in humans is caused by five species of parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium.</h4>
                <div class="row" id="tree-area"></div>
                <p>Four of these – P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale – are human malaria species that are spread
                    from one person to another via the bite of female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. There are about 400
                    different species of Anopheles mosquitoes, but only 30 of these are vectors of major importance. In recent
                    years, human cases of malaria due to P. knowlesi have been recorded – this species causes malaria among
                    monkeys in certain forested areas of South-East Asia. Current information suggests that P. knowlesi malaria is
                    not spread from person to person, but rather occurs in people when an Anopheles mosquito infected by a
                    monkey then bites and infects humans (zoonotic transmission). P. falciparum and P. vivax are the most
                    prevalent, and P. falciparum is the most dangerous, with the highest rates of complications and mortality. This
                    deadly form of malaria is a serious public health concern in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

            <p>An increasing number of countries are moving towards elimination of malaria.
                Whereas only 13 countries were estimated to have fewer than 1000 malaria cases in 2000, 33 countries are
                estimated to have achieved this milestone in 2015. Global financing for malaria control also increased from an estimated
                US$ 960 million in 2005 to US$ 2.5 billion in 2014.</p>
